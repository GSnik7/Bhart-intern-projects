Internship Projects at Bhart Intern

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I worked on during my internship with Bhart Intern. During my time there, I was given the opportunity to choose and complete two major tasks, which are outlined below.

1. Movie Recommendation System
Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a personalized movie recommendation system. This system helps users discover movies they might enjoy based on their past preferences or the preferences of similar users.

Key Features:
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similar usersâ€™ preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies similar to ones the user has previously watched.
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate results.
Real-time Recommendations: Uses up-to-date data for dynamic suggestions.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for implementation.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and handling.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms for recommendation.
Surprise: A library specialized in building recommendation systems.



2. Iris Flower Classification
Project Overview
This project involves classifying iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It's a classic problem in pattern recognition.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the dataset for optimal performance.
Model Training: Implemented several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN) to classify the flower species.
Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas & NumPy: For handling and preprocessing the dataset.
Scikit-Learn: To implement and train machine learning models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and insights.
